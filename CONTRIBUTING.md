## Package Types

Armory supports seven package types. Each lives in its own top-level directory with a definition file:

| Type    | Directory    | Definition File | Description                                |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Skill   | `skills/`    | `SKILL.md`      | Prompt-driven workflow for a task domain   |
| Agent   | `agents/`    | `AGENT.md`      | Autonomous multi-step agent with tools     |
| Rule    | `rules/`     | `RULE.md`       | Always-on behavioral constraint            |
| Command | `commands/`  | `COMMAND.md`    | Slash-command triggered workflow           |
| Hook    | `hooks/`     | `HOOK.md`       | Event-driven automation (pre/post actions) |
| Utility | `utilities/` | `UTILITY.md`    | Standalone tool or report generator        |
| Preset  | `presets/`   | `PRESET.md`     | Curated bundle of packages across types    |

## Package Structure

Each package lives in its own directory under the appropriate type directory and must contain its definition file.

### Skill (`SKILL.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What this skill does in plain language.
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  category: development
  tags: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
  difficulty: intermediate
---
```

### Agent (`AGENT.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-agent-name
description: What this agent does.
type: agent
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Rule (`RULE.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-rule-name
description: What this rule enforces.
type: rule
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Command (`COMMAND.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-command-name
description: What this command does.
type: command
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Hook (`HOOK.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-hook-name
description: What this hook does.
type: hook
trigger: pre-commit # or post-commit, pre-edit, etc.
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Utility (`UTILITY.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-utility-name
description: What this utility does.
type: utility
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Preset (`PRESET.md`)

```yaml
---
name: my-preset-name
description: What this preset bundles.
type: preset
packages:
  - skills/some-skill
  - rules/some-rule
  - hooks/some-hook
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

Optional subdirectories (for any package type):

- `references/` — documents or context files the package uses
- `scripts/` — helper scripts invoked by the package
- `assets/` — images or static files

## Versioning

Packages use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) via the `metadata.version` field in their definition file frontmatter.

| Change Type                                      | Bump  | Example            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------ |
| Breaking change to package interface or behavior | MAJOR | `1.0.0` -> `2.0.0` |
| New capability, backward-compatible              | MINOR | `1.0.0` -> `1.1.0` |
| Bug fix, typo, clarification                     | PATCH | `1.0.0` -> `1.0.1` |

After changing a version, regenerate the manifest:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_manifest.py
```

## Naming Rules

- Package names: kebab-case, maximum 64 characters
- Directory name must match the `name` field in frontmatter

## Self-Containment

Packages must be standalone. Every file a package references must live within its own directory.

**Blocked:**

- `../other-package/references/file.md` — cross-package path references
- Absolute paths to files outside the package directory
- References to files that only exist in other packages

**Why:** Packages are distributed individually via `npx skills add` and archive files. Cross-package references break when a package is installed without its dependency. The skill-evaluator flags this as a CRITICAL D5 finding.

**Shared content:** If multiple packages need the same reference file, use the template sync system (see below). Each package gets its own physical copy, managed by `scripts/sync_templates.py`.

## Shared Templates

The `_templates/` directory holds reference files shared across multiple packages. The sync system copies templates into each consuming package's `references/` directory.

**How it works:**

1. Source files live in `_templates/` (e.g., `_templates/detection-patterns.md`)
2. `scripts/sync_templates.py` defines which packages consume each template via `TEMPLATE_CONSUMERS`
3. Running the script copies templates to `{type-dir}/{consumer}/references/{template}`
4. A pre-commit hook runs sync automatically when templates or references change

**To add a shared template:**

1. Create the file in `_templates/`
2. Add the template name and consumer list to `TEMPLATE_CONSUMERS` in `scripts/sync_templates.py`
3. Run `uv run python scripts/sync_templates.py` to populate copies
4. Commit both the template and the synced copies

**To use an existing template in a new package:**

1. Add your package name to the consumer list in `scripts/sync_templates.py`
2. Run `uv run python scripts/sync_templates.py`
3. Reference the file as `references/{template}` in your definition file (local path, not `../`)

Current templates:

| Template                | Consumers                                        | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `detection-patterns.md` | humanize, linkedin-post-style, manuscript-review | AI writing detection patterns    |
| `project-detection.md`  | ship-workflow, plan-review, qa-systematic        | Stack-agnostic project detection |

## Description Rules

- Maximum 1024 characters (sweet spot: 200-800 characters)
- No angle brackets (`<`, `>`)
- No pushy trigger language ("always use", "you must", "never do")
- Include trigger phrases users would type to activate the package
- Include a "Use this skill when..." clause describing activation contexts

## Writing an Effective Description

The frontmatter description controls whether Claude activates your package. A package with deep content but a weak description delivers zero value.

**Include in every description:**

1. What the package does (functional summary)
2. Key operations or subcommands covered
3. Trigger phrases across synonym families (e.g., "review", "audit", "critique", "evaluate")
4. A "Use this skill when..." clause listing concrete activation scenarios
5. Domain-specific terms users associate with the task

**Example (good):**

```yaml
description: >
  Architecture reviews across 7 dimensions: structural integrity, scalability,
  security, performance, enterprise readiness, operational excellence, and data
  architecture. Produces scored reports with prioritized recommendations.
  Triggers on: "review architecture", "critique design", "audit system",
  "evaluate codebase", "assess scalability". Use this skill when the user
  provides a system design document or codebase and asks for feedback.
```

**Example (insufficient):**

```yaml
description: "Review architecture and provide feedback."
```

## Metadata Fields

Every package should include `category`, `tags`, and `difficulty` under `metadata:` in frontmatter.

### Category

Assign one category from the table below:

| Category        | Use For                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `development`   | Coding tools, build, debug, test, IDE integration          |
| `review`        | Code review, PR review, quality checks, auditing           |
| `security`      | Security scanning, secrets detection, vulnerability checks |
| `research`      | Literature review, academic research, critique             |
| `content`       | Writing, presentations, video, publishing                  |
| `business`      | Idea validation, market sizing, feasibility, proposals     |
| `visualization` | Diagrams, images, video rendering, visual artifacts        |
| `operations`    | Release, deployment, CI/CD, git workflow, presets           |
| `data`          | SQL, database, migration, benchmarks                       |

### Tags

Add 3-6 lowercase kebab-case tags that help users discover the package. Include:

- Domain keywords (e.g., `sql`, `python`, `security`)
- Action verbs (e.g., `code-review`, `test-generation`)
- Technology names (e.g., `pytest`, `manim`, `remotion`)

### Difficulty

| Level          | Criteria                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beginner`     | Simple single-purpose tools, minimal setup                 |
| `intermediate` | Multi-step workflows, some domain knowledge needed         |
| `advanced`     | Complex multi-phase analysis, deep domain expertise needed |

## Quality Gate — Skill Evaluator

Before submitting a PR, run the [skill-evaluator](skills/skill-evaluator/) against your package:

```bash
claude --add-dir skills/skill-evaluator --add-dir skills/my-skill-name
# Then: "Run a quick audit on skills/my-skill-name"
```

The evaluator scores 6 dimensions:

| Dimension                   | Weight | Minimum for PR |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| D1: Frontmatter Quality     | 20%    | 3/5            |
| D2: Trigger Coverage        | 18%    | 3/5            |
| D3: Structural Completeness | 20%    | 3/5            |
| D4: Content Depth           | 22%    | 3/5            |
| D5: Consistency & Integrity | 12%    | 4/5            |
| D6: CONTRIBUTING Compliance | 8%     | 4/5            |

**Minimum overall score for PR acceptance: 70% (Adequate).**

Packages scoring below 70% need improvement before review. Packages with CRITICAL findings (missing frontmatter, name mismatch) are automatically rejected.

## Eval Cases

Every skill must have eval cases in `skills/<name>/evals/cases.yaml`. These define trigger accuracy — does the skill activate on the right queries and stay silent on the wrong ones?

**Schema:**

```yaml
cases:
  - id: unique_snake_case_id
    prompt: "What the user would type"
    fixtures: []
    rubric:
      - "Expected behavior point 1"
      - "Expected behavior point 2"
    trigger_expected: true # or false
```

**Requirements:**

| Skill Status | Positive Cases (trigger_expected: true) | Negative Cases (trigger_expected: false) |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Active       | 1+ (recommended: 2+)                    | 2+                                       |
| Deprecated   | 0 (must be zero)                        | 2+                                       |

**Guidelines:**

- Positive cases should use natural language a real user would type
- Negative cases should test plausible but incorrect triggers (adjacent tasks the skill should NOT handle)
- Each case needs a unique `id` (snake_case)
- Rubric items describe what a correct response looks like, not implementation details

**Validation:**

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_evals.py
```

CI runs this on every PR. Skills without valid evals will fail the pipeline.

## Testing Locally

Point Claude Code at the package directory:

```bash
claude --add-dir skills/my-skill-name
```

Verify the package loads and behaves as expected before submitting a PR.

## Packaging

Run the packaging script to produce a distributable archive:

```bash
uv run scripts/package.py skills/my-skill-name
```
