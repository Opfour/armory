| `manuscript-provenance`| Verify authorship and computational origins   | Provenance verification report      |
| `changelog-composer`   | Generate release notes from commit history    | Formatted changelog / release notes |
| `md-to-pdf`            | Export markdown documents to PDF              | PDF file                            |

## Workflow

1. **Draft** — Write or import raw content. Use `to-markdown` to convert source material
   from other formats into markdown for a consistent working format.
2. **Refine** — Use `humanize` to remove AI-sounding patterns and restore natural voice.
   Use `doc-condenser` to tighten verbose sections or produce executive summaries.
3. **Review** — Use `manuscript-review` for a structured audit of formatting, structure,
   and prose quality. Use `manuscript-provenance` to verify that all figures, tables, and
   numbers trace to their computational origins.
4. **Publish** — Use `linkedin-post-style` to produce social media announcements. Use
   `changelog-composer` to generate release notes from commit history.
5. **Export** — Use `md-to-pdf` to produce final PDF deliverables from markdown sources.
