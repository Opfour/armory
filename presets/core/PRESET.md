# Core Preset

A minimal, opinionated baseline for Claude Code projects. Installs five packages that
cover the review-commit lifecycle without imposing language-specific constraints.

## Included Packages

| Type  | Package            | Role                                            |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Skill | pr-review          | Diff-based code review across five dimensions   |
| Skill | code-refiner       | Structural simplification preserving behavior   |
| Skill | pre-landing-review | Final merge-readiness gate                      |
| Hook  | git-protection     | Blocks force-push and branch deletion on main   |
| Rule  | commit-standards   | Enforces conventional commit message formatting |

## Workflow

1. **Develop** — write code on a feature branch.
2. **Refine** — invoke `code-refiner` to reduce complexity and improve readability.
3. **Review** — run `pr-review` against the diff to catch bugs, silent failures, and
   type issues before opening a PR.
4. **Gate** — `pre-landing-review` performs a final check before merge.
5. **Protect** — `git-protection` prevents accidental force-pushes or branch deletions.
6. **Commit** — `commit-standards` enforces message format on every commit.

## When to Use

- New projects that need a quality baseline from day one.
- Teams onboarding members who are new to Claude Code.
- Any repository where review discipline and commit hygiene matter but
  language-specific enforcement is handled separately.

## Extending

Layer additional presets on top of `core`:

- **python-strict** — adds Python-focused testing, security scanning, and stricter rules.
- **sec-strict** — adds security auditing, dependency scanning, and cost tracking.

## Complementary Agents

These orchestrator agents work well alongside the core preset:

- **codebase-auditor** — unified quality assessment across code, security, and dependencies.
- **release-captain** — ship lifecycle with quality gates, changelog, and PR creation.
- **full-stack-builder** — end-to-end implementation with testing and documentation.
