# Business Validation Suite

A curated bundle of four skills for comprehensive business idea validation.

## Included Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Key Frameworks |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `market-analyzer` | Market sizing and trend analysis | TAM/SAM/SOM, Rogers adoption curve, trend identification |
| `competitive-analyzer` | Competitive landscape assessment | Porter's Five Forces, feature matrices, positioning maps |
| `feasibility-assessor` | Financial and technical viability | Unit economics, technical risk scoring, break-even analysis |
| `idea-validator` | Full business validation (orchestrator) | Lean Canvas, JTBD, SWOT/PESTLE, integrated scoring |

## Usage Patterns

### Full Validation
Ask Claude to "validate this business idea" — triggers `idea-validator`, which orchestrates the other three skills via sub-agents.

### Focused Analysis
- "Analyze the market for X" — triggers `market-analyzer` directly
- "Who are the competitors for X" — triggers `competitive-analyzer` directly
- "Is X financially viable" — triggers `feasibility-assessor` directly

### Incremental Validation
Run individual skills in sequence, building up a complete picture:
1. Start with market analysis to confirm opportunity exists
2. Add competitive analysis to understand the landscape
3. Run feasibility to check if it can be built and sustained
4. Use idea-validator for the integrated synthesis

## Data Flow

When `idea-validator` orchestrates the full suite, the data flows as follows:

```

                            │
                            ▼
                ┌─────────────────────┐
                │  idea-validator      │  Phase 5-7: SWOT/PESTLE,
                │  (synthesis)         │  Scoring, Report
                └─────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                  Validation Report
                  (6-dimension scorecard,
                   verdict, experiments)
```

Each sub-agent returns structured findings. The orchestrator synthesizes them with SWOT/PESTLE analysis and produces a weighted validation scorecard.
