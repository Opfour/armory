# Skill Evolution Preset

An autonomous skill factory powered by co-evolutionary refinement. Installs the
complete pipeline from the EvoSkills paper (arXiv 2604.01687): generate skills,
verify them in isolated sessions, test against ground-truth oracles, and refine
until convergence.

## Included Packages

| Type    | Package              | Role                                                      |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent   | test-engineer        | Orchestrates the co-evolutionary generate-verify-refine loop |
| Skill   | surrogate-verifier   | Generates assertions and diagnostics in isolated sessions |
| Skill   | skill-distiller      | Converts Opus skills to Haiku-executable workflows        |
| Skill   | paper-to-skill       | Extracts methodologies from papers into skill specs       |
| Skill   | package-evaluator    | 6-dimensional quality scoring for all package types       |
| Skill   | immune               | Adaptive cheatsheet/antibody memory system                |
| Skill   | research-critique    | Critical analysis of research papers                      |
| Command | evolve               | One-shot skill generation via `/evolve <domain>`          |

## Workflow

1. **Create** — `/evolve <domain>` or `/evolve <arxiv-url>` to start skill generation
2. **Generate** — test-engineer produces the initial skill with immune cheatsheet injection
3. **Verify** — surrogate-verifier generates assertions in an isolated session
4. **Test** — Ground-truth oracle executes the skill and checks assertions
5. **Refine** — Diagnostics from failed assertions drive targeted improvements
6. **Distill** — Optional `--distill` flag produces Haiku-compatible version
7. **Ship** — Final package passes all validators and the package-evaluator quality gate

## When to Install

- Building an automated skill generation pipeline
- Converting research papers into reusable skills
- Improving existing skills through systematic refinement
- Creating Haiku-optimized versions of complex skills

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI (`claude`) for oracle execution in `scripts/run_evals.py`
- Python 3.12+ with `uv` for running validation scripts
