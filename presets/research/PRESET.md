description: >
  Complete academic research workflow for Claude Code. Bundles literature discovery
  (arXiv search), systematic literature review, single-paper critical analysis,
  manuscript pre-publication audit, and computational provenance verification into
  a single install. Covers the full research lifecycle from surveying a field through
  writing and validating a manuscript. Use this preset when setting up a research
  project, academic writing environment, or scholarly review workflow.

# Research Preset

An end-to-end scholarly workflow for discovering, evaluating, synthesizing, and publishing
academic research.

## Included Packages

| Type    | Package              | Role                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Utility | arxiv-search         | Search arXiv for papers, retrieve structured metadata    |
| Skill   | literature-review    | Systematic review: search, screen, extract, synthesize   |
| Skill   | research-critique    | Critical analysis of a single paper's merit              |
| Skill   | manuscript-review    | Pre-publication audit of formatting, structure, citations |
| Skill   | manuscript-provenance| Verify manuscript numbers trace to computational outputs |

## Workflow

1. **Discover** — Use `arxiv-search` to find papers on a topic. Query by keyword,
   author, category, or specific arXiv IDs.
2. **Survey** — Use `literature-review` to systematically screen, extract, and synthesize
   findings across the discovered papers. Produces thematic reviews, comparison tables,
   or gap analyses.
3. **Evaluate** — Use `research-critique` for deep analysis of individual papers —
   methodology, claims-evidence alignment, contribution significance.
4. **Write** — Draft manuscript with the context and citations gathered in prior steps.
5. **Audit** — Use `manuscript-review` for a 24-checkpoint pre-submission audit covering
   structure, citation hygiene, prose quality, and AI-pattern detection.
6. **Verify** — Use `manuscript-provenance` to confirm every number, table, and figure
   in the manuscript traces to code and computational outputs.

## When to Use

- Research projects requiring systematic literature surveys.
- Academic writing workflows from literature review to submission.
- Thesis chapters or dissertation work.
- Conference/journal paper preparation.
- Grant proposal background research.

## Dependencies

The `arxiv-search` utility requires the `arxiv` Python package:

```bash
uv pip install arxiv
```

All other packages are prompt-only skills with no additional dependencies.
