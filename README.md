[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![packages: 92](https://img.shields.io/badge/packages-92-informational)](manifest.yaml) [![evals: 100%](https://img.shields.io/badge/eval_coverage-100%25-success)](skills/)

Curated, production-grade skills, agents, hooks, rules, commands, utilities, and presets for AI coding agents. No magic, no demos — battle-tested workflows built for developers who use AI seriously.

---

## Overview

`armory` is a collection of packages for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and Claude.ai. Each package is a self-contained prompt or automation unit that extends Claude with a repeatable, opinionated workflow for a specific task domain. Packages span seven types: skills, agents, hooks, rules, commands, utilities, and presets.

**Philosophy:** Packages in this collection are practical and context-free. They define the _how_, not just the _what_ — covering inputs, outputs, edge cases, and failure modes. They are tested in real workloads, not constructed as examples.

Intended for developers who treat AI coding agents as a serious part of their workflow.

## Package Catalog

### Agents — Orchestrators

Orchestrator agents compose skills and other agents into multi-phase workflows. Each can run solo or be spawned by another agent via the Agent tool.

| Preset                                    | Packages                                          | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [core](presets/core/)                     | 3 skills, 1 hook, 1 rule                          | Baseline review-commit lifecycle. Start here.                                                            |
| [sec-strict](presets/sec-strict/)         | 5 skills, 3 agents, 2 rules, 2 hooks, 1 command   | Audit-grade security stack with codebase-auditor. Superset of `core`.                                    |
| [python-strict](presets/python-strict/)   | 4 skills, 2 agents, 3 rules, 2 hooks, 2 commands  | Full Python enforcement — TDD, type checking, test coverage, security standards.                         |
| [ai-builder](presets/ai-builder/)         | 6 skills                                          | AI/ML development toolkit — agent building, prompt engineering, GPU optimization, RAG auditing.           |

### Deprecated Presets

Superseded by orchestrator agents that provide autonomous workflow orchestration instead of manual skill invocation.

| Preset | Replacement |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ~~biz-validation~~ | `idea-scout` agent |
| ~~media-craft~~ | `media-producer` agent |
| ~~content-ops~~ | `content-strategist` agent |
| ~~research~~ | `research-analyst` agent |
| ~~eng-ops~~ | `release-captain` + `full-stack-builder` agents |

## Installation

**Option 1 — Skills CLI (recommended)**

Install any package directly using [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
# Install all packages
npx skills add Mathews-Tom/armory

# Install a specific skill or agent
npx skills add Mathews-Tom/armory -s architecture-reviewer
npx skills add Mathews-Tom/armory -s codebase-auditor

# List available packages without installing
npx skills add Mathews-Tom/armory -l
```

**Option 2 — Profile installer**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/armory.git
cd armory

# Install by profile
just install-profile core
just install-profile python-strict

# Install by type
uv run scripts/install.py --type skills
uv run scripts/install.py --type agents

# Interactive TUI
uv run scripts/install.py
```

Displays a version-aware table of all packages, detects installed versions, and lets you select which to install or upgrade. Profiles install curated bundles of packages across all types.

**Option 3 — Manual**

Clone the repo and symlink individual package folders:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/armory.git

# Skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/armory/skills/architecture-reviewer" ~/.claude/skills/architecture-reviewer

# Agents
ln -s "$(pwd)/armory/agents/codebase-auditor" ~/.claude/agents/codebase-auditor
```

Or download `.skill` / `.agent` archives from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

## Usage

Packages activate when Claude detects a matching intent. Each package defines trigger phrases in its frontmatter description — check the definition file (`SKILL.md`, `AGENT.md`, etc.) in each folder.

**Example triggers:**

```text
"Run a security audit before I push this to GitHub"
-> activates: repo-sentinel (skill)

"Review this code for quality issues"
-> activates: code-reviewer (agent)

"Evaluate the quality of this package"
-> activates: package-evaluator (skill)
```

**Commands** are invoked explicitly via slash syntax:

```text
/tdd calculate_discount    -> TDD workflow for a function
/security-scan src/        -> security vulnerability audit
/refactor src/utils.py     -> code simplification
```

**Hooks** fire automatically on Claude Code lifecycle events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionStart). **Rules** load as context when relevant. **Presets** install bundles via `just install-profile`.

---

## Package Quality

Every package is evaluated against 6 shared dimensions using the [package-evaluator](skills/package-evaluator/), with type-specific signals for agents, hooks, rules, commands, utilities, and presets:

| Dimension               | Weight | What it measures                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontmatter Quality     | 20%    | Description length, trigger phrases, "Use when" clause           |
| Trigger Coverage        | 18%    | Synonym breadth, implied contexts, interrogative forms           |
| Structural Completeness | 20%    | Workflow, error handling, output format, type-specific metadata  |
| Content Depth           | 22%    | Decision frameworks, multi-step workflows, type-specific signals |
| Consistency & Integrity | 12%    | Name matching, file references, description-body alignment       |
| CONTRIBUTING Compliance | 8%     | Naming conventions, length limits, YAML validity                 |

---

## Eval Coverage

Every package has eval cases in `{type}/<name>/evals/cases.yaml` — positive triggers (should activate) and negative triggers (should not). Deprecated packages enforce 0 positive + 2 negative cases.

**Validation:**

```bash
uv run scripts/validate_evals.py    # Schema validation for all eval files
uv run scripts/generate_manifest.py # Regenerate manifest.yaml
```

**CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/evals.yml`):

- **PR gate**: validates manifest sync + eval schema on every pull request across all 7 type directories
- **Weekly cron**: Monday runs for model drift detection

**Pre-commit hook**: auto-regenerates `manifest.yaml` when any package definition file changes.

---

## Packaging

Each package can be archived for distribution. Archive type is auto-detected from the directory:

```bash
uv run scripts/package.py skills/architecture-reviewer  # produces .skill
uv run scripts/package.py agents/code-reviewer           # produces .agent
uv run scripts/package.py hooks/git-protection            # produces .hook
```

---

## Cross-Platform Adapters

Packages are authored as Claude Code-native definitions. The adapter generator transforms them into platform-specific formats for Cursor, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI.

### Generate

```bash
# All platforms
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py

# Single platform
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform cursor
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform codex
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform gemini

# Filter by package type
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform cursor --type skills --type rules

# Preview without writing
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --dry-run
```

Output lands in `adapters/{platform}/` (gitignored — generated, not source).

### Platform Mapping

| Armory Type | Cursor | Codex | Gemini |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Skills** | `.cursor/rules/{name}.mdc` | `skills/AGENTS.md` | `.gemini/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| **Agents** | `.cursor/rules/{name}.mdc` | `agents/AGENTS.md` | `.gemini/agents/{name}.md` |
| **Rules** | `.cursor/rules/{name}.mdc` (alwaysApply) | `standards/AGENTS.md` | Sections in `GEMINI.md` |
| **Commands** | `.cursor/commands/{name}.md` | `workflows/AGENTS.md` | `.gemini/commands/workflow/{name}.toml` |
| **Hooks** | — | — | — |
| **Utilities** | — | — | Wrapped as `.gemini/skills/` |
| **Presets** | — | — | — |

### Use with Cursor

Copy the generated `.cursor/` directory into your project root:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform cursor
cp -r adapters/cursor/.cursor /path/to/your/project/
```

Rules with `alwaysApply: true` (project standards) load on every prompt. Skills and agents load when Cursor matches the description or glob pattern.

### Use with OpenAI Codex

Copy the generated Codex directory to your project root:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform codex
cp adapters/codex/AGENTS.md /path/to/your/project/
cp -r adapters/codex/{standards,agents,workflows,skills} /path/to/your/project/
```

The root `AGENTS.md` is a condensed index under the 32 KiB budget. Full content is in subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files, loaded via Codex's hierarchical discovery when the working directory matches.

### Use with Gemini CLI

Copy the generated `.gemini/` directory into your project root:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_adapters.py --platform gemini
cp -r adapters/gemini/.gemini /path/to/your/project/
```

Skills are a near 1:1 copy (references, scripts, and assets included). Rules become sections in `GEMINI.md`. Commands are converted to TOML format. Agents are markdown files with cleaned frontmatter.

### What's Lost

Not all package types have equivalents on every platform:

- **Hooks** have no equivalent on Cursor or Codex. Gemini has hooks but uses a different event model.
- **Presets** require a dependency resolver that no target platform provides.
- **Utilities** with executable scripts are skipped on Cursor and Codex (passive context only). Gemini wraps them as skills.
