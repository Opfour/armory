# Proposal Writer

Technical proposal generation that combines ROI modeling, calibrated estimates,
and business-value framing into a structured, client-ready document with
three pricing tiers and optional PDF export.

---

## Scope and Trigger Conditions

### Activate when:

- User requests a client-facing technical proposal
- User asks to draft a proposal with pricing or ROI analysis
- User needs a bid document with scope, timeline, and cost breakdown
- User wants to convert a technical plan into a business proposal
- User asks for a proposal with multiple pricing tiers
- User needs a scoped engagement document with deliverables and milestones

### Do NOT activate when:

- User asks for an internal architecture decision document (use `project-architect` agent)
- User asks for a project plan or timeline only (use `project-planner` agent)
- User asks for a content strategy or marketing copy (use `content-strategist` agent)
- User asks for effort estimation only (use `estimate-calibrator` skill)
- User asks for a technical spec without business context or pricing
- User asks for a slide deck or presentation (different format, different agent)

## Input Requirements

| Input                 | Required | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project scope         | Yes      | What the project delivers — features, systems, integrations.            |
| Technical approach    | No       | Architecture, stack, methodology. Derived from scope if omitted.        |
| Budget range          | No       | Client budget constraints. Used to calibrate tier pricing.              |
| Client context        | No       | Industry, company size, decision makers, pain points. Improves framing. |
| Architecture document | No       | Existing architecture from `project-architect`. Feeds solution section. |
| Timeline constraints  | No       | Hard deadlines, phasing requirements. Feeds milestone table.            |

If project scope is missing, ask for it before proceeding. Do not draft a proposal without a defined scope.

If technical approach is missing, derive it from scope and state assumptions explicitly in the proposal.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Input Collection

1. Confirm project scope is present. If missing, request it and halt.
2. Identify available inputs: technical approach, budget range, client context, architecture document, timeline constraints.
3. Ask for missing inputs that materially improve proposal quality:
   - Architecture document (from `project-architect`)
   - Timeline or phasing plan (from `project-planner`)
   - Budget range or procurement constraints
   - Decision makers and evaluation criteria
4. Do not block on optional inputs — proceed after one round of clarification.
5. Summarize collected inputs and confirmed assumptions before moving to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: ROI Modeling

1. Invoke the `estimate-calibrator` skill with the project scope and technical approach to produce effort estimates (hours, cost ranges) for each deliverable.
2. Calculate cost savings:
   - Current cost of the problem (manual effort, inefficiency, lost revenue)
   - Post-implementation cost with the proposed solution
   - Net savings per month/quarter/year
3. Calculate efficiency gains:
   - Time saved per process cycle
   - Throughput improvement (percentage or absolute)
4. Calculate revenue impact where applicable:
   - New revenue enabled by the solution
   - Revenue protected (risk mitigation)
5. Compute payback period: total investment / monthly net benefit.
6. Compute 3-year ROI: ((3-year net benefit - total investment) / total investment) \* 100.
7. Use specific numbers. Replace every "significant savings" with a dollar figure or percentage.

### Phase 3: Solution Framing

1. Structure the value proposition using Problem-Agitate-Solve:
   - **Problem:** State the business challenge in the client's language.
   - **Agitate:** Quantify the cost of inaction — what happens if they do nothing for 6-12 months.
   - **Solve:** Present the proposed solution as the bridge from current state to desired state.
2. Translate technical capabilities into business outcomes:
   - "Microservice decomposition" becomes "independent scaling reduces infrastructure cost by X%"
   - "CI/CD pipeline" becomes "releases move from 2-week cycles to same-day, reducing time-to-market"
3. Anchor every claim to a number from Phase 2.

### Phase 4: Proposal Drafting

Produce the structured proposal document using the Output Format below. Sections:

1. **Executive Summary** — 3-4 sentences: problem, solution, expected ROI, investment range.
2. **The Challenge** — Problem-Agitate framing with quantified cost of inaction.
3. **Proposed Solution** — Solution description in business language with technical depth as appendix.
4. **Scope of Work** — Three columns: Included, Excluded, Optional add-ons. Be explicit on boundaries.
5. **Deliverables** — Table with deliverable name, description, acceptance criteria, and target date.
6. **Timeline & Milestones** — Phased timeline with milestone names, dates, and gate criteria.
7. **Investment** — Three pricing tiers:
   - **Essential:** Core scope, minimum viable delivery.
   - **Professional:** Full scope with recommended additions.
   - **Enterprise:** Full scope plus premium options (extended support, SLA, training).
     Each tier lists: included items, price, payment schedule.
8. **Return on Investment** — ROI table from Phase 2 with payback period and 3-year projection.
9. **Team & Approach** — Methodology, team composition, communication cadence.
10. **Governance** — Change request process, escalation path, status reporting.
11. **Terms** — Proposal validity (30 days), payment terms, IP ownership, confidentiality.
12. **Next Steps** — Concrete actions with owners and dates.

### Phase 5: Visual Enhancement

1. Invoke the `architecture-diagram` skill to generate a solution architecture diagram based on the technical approach.
2. Embed the diagram in the Proposed Solution section.
3. If the architecture diagram skill is unavailable, describe the architecture in a structured text block and note that a visual diagram can be added.

### Phase 6: Export

1. If the user requests PDF output, invoke the `md-to-pdf` skill to convert the proposal markdown to PDF.
2. Apply professional formatting: cover page, headers/footers, page numbers, table of contents.
3. Return both the markdown source and the PDF path.

## Rules

1. Lead with business value, not technical details — the executive summary mentions ROI before architecture.
2. Quantify ROI with specific numbers — never use "significant", "substantial", or "improved" without a figure.
3. Always offer three pricing tiers (Essential / Professional / Enterprise) — never a single price point.
4. Be explicit about scope inclusions AND exclusions — ambiguity causes disputes.
5. Never overpromise — use calibrated estimates from `estimate-calibrator`, present ranges not point estimates.
6. Set proposal expiration to 30 days from generation date.
7. Include clear next steps with owners and target dates — the proposal must end with a call to action.
8. Do not use generic templates without customization — every section must reference the specific project, client, and context.
9. If critical inputs are missing (project scope), halt and request them rather than generating a vague proposal.
10. Frame technical decisions as business decisions — every architecture choice maps to a cost, risk, or timeline impact.
