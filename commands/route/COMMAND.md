name: route

description: >-
  Skill router that maps user tasks to the best armory packages. Provides a
  decision-tree organized by development lifecycle phase (define, plan, build,
  verify, review, ship) plus cross-cutting domains (research, content, business).
  Triggers on: "/route", "which skill", "what package", "find the right skill",
  "help me pick a skill", "discover packages". Use this command when unsure
  which armory skill, agent, or command to use for a task.

# Route — Skill & Package Discovery

When the user invokes `/route [task]`, match their task to the best armory package(s) using the decision tree below. If the task is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before recommending.

## How to Use This Router

1. Read the user's task description
2. Match to the most specific category below
3. Recommend the **primary** package and any **complementary** packages
4. If the MCP armory server is available, cross-reference with `search_packages` for confirmation
5. **Outcome-weighted routing (optional):** if `dist/router_index.json` exists
   and the user wants rankings by historical pass rate rather than the static
   tree, delegate to the `skill-router` agent. The agent falls back to this
   static tree when the index is missing or confidence is low. See
   `agents/skill-router/AGENT.md`.
